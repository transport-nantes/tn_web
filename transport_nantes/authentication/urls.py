This implements a registration and login system with the following
properties:

[Done]
1.  Create new accounts.
2.  Login with emailed magic link.
3.  Logout.

[TODO]
4.  Login by password as an option.  The code is in the template, but
    we don't currently look at it.  If it's non-empty and matches, we
    should use it and set the auth-by-email flag to False.
5.  Settings.  Permit changing email address and password as well as
    toggling auth_by_password.  Changing email or password should
    pass through a validation token.  We'll need to encrypt the
    password or else remember it.

This is all based on
