    """Create a new TBItem or modify an existing one.

    It uses the fields of TopicBlogItem model to generate a form
    displayed inside the template set on template_name.
    The form exludes some fields that should not be accessible by the user.
    However admins can still edit those fields, for example the author.

    To create a new TopicBlogItem, the user must go on the url
    /tb/admin/new where the form is displayed with empty fields.

    If an existing item doesn't have a slug yet, it's possible to edit it
    by going to /tb/admin/edit/<PKid> however if it does already have a slug
    then you must also provide the slug to edit it.
    For example :
    /tb/admin/edit/15/la-grande-mobilite/ would return a 200 status code
    if the item with PK 15 has the slug la-grande-mobilite.
    However it would return a 404 status code you try to edit it from
    /tb/admin/edit/15/.

    It's possible to edit an item by its slug, the form will load the
    instance of the item with the slug and the highest item_sort_key.
